# stock-analysis

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

The purpose of this challenge is to refactor the code to be able to analyze a large portion of stock data in a faster and more efficient way by looping through all the data one time.

### Background Information

A customer provided a dataset containing the stock information (ticker value, the stock issuing date, opening/closing/adjusted closing and highest/lowest prices, the volume) for the years of 2017 and 2018. An initially written code was functional in evaluating a small number of stocks, however, might appear to be inefficient and time consuming in analyzing large quantities of stocks. Thus, we have been asked to defactor the current code to accommodate larger stock datasets. 

## Results

The final analysis of the stock datasets for 2017 and 2018 years revealed higher Total Daily Volume for most of the stock trading in 2017, thus, leading to growth/higher returns at the end of the calendar year. The Total Daily Volume significantly dropped in 2018 resulting in substantial financial losses. There were only two stocks that had showed a higher total daily volume and a growth/higher return in 2018. 

Please see the tables below. Growth is shown in green and losses are shown in red.
